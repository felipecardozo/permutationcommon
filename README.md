Instructions: Solve the following year through the algorithm more

simple.

Assume that the application receive input lines through a

plain text file without any particular format.

Statement: Given two strings A and B, printed on the console

string X longest possible provided it is a permutation of

and talque A subsequence is a permutation of a subsequence B.

Input data: Data entered into a flat file which contains

several cases. Each event consists of two consecutive lines, so

the line 1 and line 2 are a case, line 3 and line 4 are another

case and so on.

Each line contains a string of lowercase characters maximum 1000

characters.

Output data: For each set of input data to be printed X

on the console. If multiple X, printed in alphabetical order.
